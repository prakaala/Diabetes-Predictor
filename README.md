This jupyter-notebook contains code that implements Machine Learning Models. I have used 3 Machine Learning Models: 
//
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Artificial Neural Networks
//
and analyzed their performance through precision, accuracy and recall.
//
The models are used from scikit-learn's models, and trained through the given dataset.
